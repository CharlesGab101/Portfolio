### CPSC 120

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2, was my favorite because I was amazed at how the data is 
    stored in the vector, and this is what I noticed that folders store 
    multiple types of data inside. I learned that vectors are very helpful 
    for storing various data sets in a file. 
    I like how we search each of the rows and 
    In order we take out the date from the file.

* Lab 6 
    
    Lab 6, part 2, was also my favorite because I like how the code 
    is working with different functions, and each function has 
    its own behavior or actions. Also, how the system works for the Blackjack
    game and is playable for users. The functions are very helpful
    for calculating the amount of points for the game of Blackjack.

* Lab 9 

    Lab 9 was interesting because there was a part of the lab where 
    we could detect each index in the text. The Compare code was also 
    an interesting part because I was able to choose what letter in the index. 
    This is very helpful if we want to detect anomalies.
